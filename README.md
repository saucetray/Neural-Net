## This was Cool!

This was pretty cool in my adventure into functional programming. I got to see the interesting things 
that functional programming can get away with. It's pretty interesting writing the code. Testing is also pretty nice 
in the functional approach which I did not expect! 

This is something I will keep working on for fun. Functional programming is clearly fire ðŸ”¥.
